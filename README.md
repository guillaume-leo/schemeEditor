# SchemeEditor

## An Electron/Codemirror journey

It's been a while I was turning around Electron and its world. I also always been avid of text/code editors.

After some research I found [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/), a wonderful js library to create text/code editor in the browser. Really easy to use it quickly became the best candidate for this project.

I also really like the Scheme programming language, so why not creating a Scheme code editor with codemirror and electron?

It's my first experience in creating an app, and with electron in addition. Don't expect something well organized in here it's spaghetti code from the beginning to the end. And above all, this is just the beginning of the project, it's still in development and I have a bunch of features I would like to add, so all of this will change soon.

### instructions

0/ Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed on your computer

1/ clone the repo

2/ in the folder run : "npm install", and then to launch the app "npm start"

When the app is launched you are in front of a black-screen, no worries it's normal. Just put the "example" folder path inside the box at the top and press enter.

You should now see the files on the left. Just click on them to create new codemirror windows.
